            <p>Now let’s say that you have a problem and you need to solve it manually how would you solve it? the answer is some math or some logic how would it be if it is solved by the computer? That is what we call programming. programming is actually writing your logic and math or an analogy you develop in your brain to solve a problem in a language that the computer understands</p>
